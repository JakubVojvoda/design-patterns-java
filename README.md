## Java Design Patterns

Software design patterns are general reusable solutions to problems which occur
over and over again in object-oriented design enviroment. It is not a finished 
design that can be transformed into source code directly, but it is template how
to solve the problem. Templates in this repository are based mainly on book 
[Design Patterns by The "Gang of Four"]. We can classify them by purpose
into creational (abstract the instantiation process), structure (how classes and 
objects are composed to form larger structures) and behavioral patterns (the 
assignment of responsibilities between objects).  

- Creational Patterns 
 - [Abstract Factory]
 - [Builder]
 - [Factory Method]
 - [Prototype]
 - [Singleton] 
- Structural Patterns
 - [Adapter]
 - [Bridge] 
 - [Composite]
 - [Decorator]
 - [Façade]
 - [Flyweight]
 - [Proxy]
- Behavioral Patterns
 - [Chain of Responsibility]
 - [Command]
 - [Interpreter]
 - [Iterator]
 - [Mediator]
 - [Memento] 
 - [Observer]
 - [State]
 - [Strategy]
 - [Template Method]
 - [Visitor]
